# Organizations API Documentation

## Overview
The Organizations API is the foundational API for managing multi-tenant pharmaceutical companies and research organizations within the Clinical Dashboard Platform. It provides complete lifecycle management for organizations including creation, configuration, user management, and compliance tracking.

## Business Purpose

### Why This API Exists
1. **Multi-tenancy Foundation**: Enables the platform to serve multiple pharmaceutical companies with complete data isolation
2. **Compliance Requirements**: Pharmaceutical companies require strict data segregation for regulatory compliance
3. **Centralized Management**: Provides a single point of control for organization-level settings and configurations
4. **Scalability**: Allows the platform to onboard new pharmaceutical companies without system modifications

### Key Business Benefits
- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation of data between organizations
- **Customization**: Each organization can have custom settings, branding, and workflows
- **User Management**: Centralized control over user access and permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for regulatory compliance
- **Cost Allocation**: Usage tracking per organization for billing purposes

## API Endpoints

### 1. List Organizations
```http
GET /api/v1/organizations
```

**Purpose**: Retrieve a paginated list of organizations accessible to the current user.

**Business Need**: 
- Super admins need to view all organizations for platform management

    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "compliance_mode": "21CFR11",
    "data_retention_days": 2555,
    "require_electronic_signatures": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Get Organization Details
```http
GET /api/v1/organizations/{org_id}
```

**Purpose**: Retrieve comprehensive details about a specific organization.

**Business Need**:
- View organization configuration
- Audit organization settings
- Display organization profile
- Check compliance status

### 4. Update Organization
```http
PUT /api/v1/organizations/{org_id}
```

**Purpose**: Update organization settings and configuration.

**Business Need**:
- Change organization details
- Update compliance settings
- Modify data retention policies
- Update contact information

### 5. Delete Organization
```http
DELETE /api/v1/organizations/{org_id}
```

**Purpose**: Soft delete an organization (archive).

**Business Need**:
- Deactivate organizations
- Maintain data for audit purposes
- Comply with data retention requirements
- Handle contract terminations

**Note**: Organizations are never hard deleted due to regulatory requirements. Data is archived and access is revoked.

## Compliance Features

### 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance
- **Audit Trail**: Every organization change is logged with user, timestamp, and reason
- **Electronic Signatures**: Updates to critical settings require e-signatures
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for organization management
- **Data Integrity**: Checksums ensure organization data hasn't been tampered with

### HIPAA Compliance
- **Encryption**: All organization data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Logging**: Every access to organization data is logged
- **Minimum Necessary**: Users only see organizations they need access to
- **Business Associate Agreements**: Tracked at organization level

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Authentication**: All requests require valid JWT token
- **Role-Based Access**: 
  - `SUPERUSER`: Full access to all organizations
  - `ORG_ADMIN`: Full access to their organization
  - `ORG_USER`: Read-only access to their organization
- **IP Whitelisting**: Optional per-organization IP restrictions

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- **Secure Transmission**: TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all input data
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Organization list cached for 5 minutes
- Organization details cached for 15 minutes
- Cache invalidated on any update

### Database Optimization
- Indexed on: `id`, `code`, `status`, `created_at`
- Partitioned by creation year for large deployments
- Read replicas for GET operations

### Rate Limiting
- 1000 requests per hour for list operations
- 100 requests per hour for create/update operations
- Burst allowance of 50 requests per minute

## Integration Points

### Downstream Dependencies
1. **Users API**: Organization determines user permissions
2. **Studies API**: Studies belong to organizations
3. **Billing Service**: Organization usage tracked for billing
4. **Audit Service**: All changes logged to audit system

### Upstream Dependencies
1. **Authentication Service**: Validates user tokens
2. **Permission Service**: Checks user access rights
3. **Configuration Service**: Default settings

## Error Handling

### Common Error Codes
- `ORG001`: Organization not found
- `ORG002`: Organization code already exists
- `ORG003`: Insufficient permissions
- `ORG004`: Invalid organization type
- `ORG005`: Organization has active studies (cannot delete)

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ORG002",
    "message": "Organization code 'GPS' already exists",
    "field": "code",
    "suggestion": "Try a different organization code"
  }
}
```
