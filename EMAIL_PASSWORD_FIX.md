# Email Password Issue - FIXED âœ…

## Problem Solved
The SMTP password wasn't being saved to the database due to two issues:
1. Frontend was incorrectly setting empty passwords to `undefined`
2. No consistent encryption key across container restarts

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Frontend Password Handling
**File**: `frontend/src/app/admin/email/page.tsx`
- Fixed logic to properly send password updates to backend
- Only excludes password from payload when updating without changing it

### 2. Encryption Key Consistency
**Files Modified**:
- `.env` - Added ENCRYPTION_KEY
- `docker-compose.local-dev.yml` - Added ENCRYPTION_KEY to all services

**Encryption Key Added**:
```
ENCRYPTION_KEY=SZHqT7JYLsFghGNdnJO5lFjA3XvILUFOHMKoId8NzLE0x1kXq9hR7KfzYDJfFsw=
```

## âœ… Setup Complete - Please Re-enter Password

Since we've reset the encryption, you need to re-enter your SMTP password:

### Step 1: Re-enter SMTP Password
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin/email
2. Keep all settings as they are
3. **Enter your GoDaddy password** in the password field
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. You should see "Settings saved successfully!"

### Step 2: Test Email Sending
1. Stay on the Email Settings page
2. Click on the **"Testing"** tab
3. Enter your email: `amulyabista@yahoo.com`
4. Click "Send Test Email"
5. **Check your Yahoo inbox** - you should receive a real email!

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Your password is now encrypted with a consistent key
- The encryption key is stored in `.env` and docker-compose.yml
- Password is encrypted before storage in database
- Decryption happens only when needed for SMTP connection

## ðŸ“§ Your Current Settings

```
Host: smtpout.secureserver.net
Port: 587
Username: admin@sagarmatha.ai
From Email: admin@sagarmatha.ai
TLS: Enabled
```

## ðŸŽ¯ What to Expect

After re-entering your password and sending a test email:
1. Email will be sent through GoDaddy's SMTP server
2. It will arrive in your real Yahoo inbox
3. The email history will show in the History tab
4. You can use this for all system emails (user creation, backups, etc.)

## ðŸ’¡ Troubleshooting

If the test email doesn't arrive:
1. Check spam/junk folder in Yahoo
2. Verify the password is correct (GoDaddy email password)
3. Check the History tab for any error messages
4. Try port 465 with SSL instead of 587 with TLS

## âœ¨ Ready to Use!

Once you receive the test email in your Yahoo inbox, your email system is fully configured and ready for production use with real emails through your sagarmatha.ai domain!
