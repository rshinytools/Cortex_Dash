## Implementation Phases Summary

### Phase 1: Core Widget Library ✅
Create flexible MetricCard widget with aggregation capabilities

### Phase 2: Data Source Management 📁
Upload, convert to parquet, version management

### Phase 3: Data Pipeline System 🔄
Python script execution with version control

### Phase 4: Widget Data Mapping 🔗
Configure widgets to use specific datasets and calculations

### Phase 5: Auto-Refresh System ♻️
Handle data updates and automatic widget refresh

### Phase 6: Query Execution 🚀
Efficient parquet querying with caching

### Phase 7: Integration & Polish ✨
Complete workflow integration and UX improvements

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No SDTM/ADaM Constraints** - Works with any data format
2. **Manual Version Control** - Admin controls script activation
3. **Automatic Data Refresh** - Widgets always use latest data
4. **Visual Filter Builder** - Complex logic made simple
5. **Parquet Format** - Optimized for analytics queries
6. **Redis Caching** - Fast response times

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Implementation Plan](./widget-system-implementation-plan.md)
2. Understand the [Workflow](./widget-system-workflow-summary.md)
3. Start with Phase 1 - Core Widget Library
4. Use the checklist to track progress
