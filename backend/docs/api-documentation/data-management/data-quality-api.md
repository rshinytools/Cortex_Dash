## Compliance Features

### 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance
- **Audit Trail**: All operations logged with user, timestamp, and details
- **Electronic Signatures**: Critical operations require e-signatures
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions enforced
- **Data Integrity**: Validation and verification mechanisms

### Data Standards
- **CDISC Compliance**: Supports SDTM, ADaM, and Define-XML standards
- **Industry Standards**: Follows clinical trial best practices
- **Validation**: Automated compliance checking

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication required
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Study and organization-level permissions
- API key support for automation

### Data Protection
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection

## Integration Points

### Dependencies
- Integrates with core platform services
- Connects to external systems as needed
- Supports webhook notifications
- RESTful API design

## Error Handling

### Standard Error Response
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERR001",
    "message": "Descriptive error message",
    "details": {},
    "timestamp": "2025-01-21T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Pagination for large datasets
- Caching strategies implemented
- Async processing for long operations
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
