# Study Management Settings - Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the phased implementation approach for creating a unified Study Management Center that allows system administrators to edit and manage studies after initialization. The system reuses existing initialization workflow components in a tabbed interface.

**Core Principle**: Reuse the initialization wizard components with edit mode capabilities.

## üéØ Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. Create a single management interface at `/studies/[id]/manage`
2. Enable system admins to update study configurations post-initialization
3. Reuse existing initialization components (70% code reuse)
4. Support data versioning and source switching
5. Handle new widget mapping requirements

### Success Criteria
- [ ] System admins can update study information
- [ ] System admins can upload new data (replace/append)
- [ ] System admins can switch between manual/API data sources
- [ ] System admins can map newly added widgets
- [ ] System admins can change dashboard templates

3. **Risk**: API integration failures
   - **Mitigation**: Fallback to manual upload, comprehensive error handling

4. **Risk**: Performance issues with large datasets
   - **Mitigation**: Pagination, lazy loading, virtual scrolling

5. **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in admin features
   - **Mitigation**: Strict RBAC enforcement, audit logging

## üìù Notes

### Implementation Guidelines
- Always check for system admin role before allowing access
- Create new data version folders, never modify existing
