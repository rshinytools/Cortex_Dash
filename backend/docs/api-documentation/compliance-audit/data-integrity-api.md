# Data Integrity API Documentation

## Overview
The Data Integrity API ensures clinical trial data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered throughout its lifecycle, implementing ALCOA+ principles for data integrity.

## Business Purpose

### Why This API Exists
1. **Regulatory Requirements: ALCOA+ compliance**
2. **Data Trust: Ensure data reliability**
3. **Quality Assurance: Detect data corruption**
4. **Legal Protection: Prove data authenticity**
5. **Scientific Validity: Maintain research integrity**


### Key Business Benefits
1. **Data Confidence: Verified integrity**
2. **Regulatory Compliance: Meet FDA standards**
3. **Risk Mitigation: Early corruption detection**
4. **Legal Defense: Proof of integrity**
5. **Quality Improvement: Continuous monitoring**

## Compliance Features

### 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance
- **Audit Trail**: All operations logged with user, timestamp, and details
- **Electronic Signatures**: Critical operations require e-signatures where applicable
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions strictly enforced
- **Data Integrity**: Validation and verification mechanisms in place

### Industry Standards
- **CDISC Compliance**: Supports clinical data standards where applicable
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Protected health information handled securely
- **GDPR Compliance**: Personal data protection and privacy rights
- **GxP Guidelines**: Good practices for regulated environments

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication required for all endpoints
- Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced
- Organization and study-level permissions
- API key support for system integrations

### Data Protection
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection

## Integration Points

### Internal Dependencies
- Integrates with core platform services
- Leverages shared authentication and authorization
- Uses common data models and schemas
- Participates in distributed transactions where needed

### External Integrations
- Webhook support for event notifications
- RESTful API design for easy integration
- Standardized error responses
- Comprehensive API documentation

## Error Handling

### Standard Error Response
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "DIG001",
    "message": "Descriptive error message",
    "field": "field_name",
    "details": {
      "additional": "context"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-01-21T10:00:00Z",
    "request_id": "req_123456"
  }
}
```

### Common Error Codes
- `DIG001`: Resource not found
- `DIG002`: Validation error
- `DIG003`: Unauthorized access
- `DIG004`: Resource conflict
- `DIG005`: Server error

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Pagination for large result sets (default: 20, max: 100)
- Response caching where appropriate
- Database query optimization with indexes
- Asynchronous processing for long operations
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support
- Load balancing ready
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- CDN support for static assets

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics Tracked
- API response times
- Error rates by endpoint
- Request volumes
- Resource utilization
- User activity patterns

### Alerting
- Performance degradation
- Error rate thresholds
- Security incidents
- Resource constraints
- System availability

## Best Practices

### API Usage
1. Always use pagination for list endpoints
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Respect rate limits
4. Cache responses where appropriate
5. Use appropriate HTTP methods

### Data Management
1. Validate input data client-side and server-side
2. Use transactions for data consistency
3. Implement optimistic locking where needed
4. Archive old data according to policies
5. Regular backups and testing
